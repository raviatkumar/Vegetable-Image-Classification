# **Project Title : Vegetable Image Classification Using CNN**

Problem Description:

Title: Vegetable Image Classification

Description:

Vegetable Image Classification aims to develop a deep neural network model capable of accurately detecting and classifying various types of common vegetables. The dataset consists of 15 classes, each representing a different vegetable, including bean, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, brinjal, broccoli, cabbage, capsicum, carrot, cauliflower, cucumber, papaya, potato, pumpkin, radish, and tomato. Each class contains 1400 images of size 224Ã—224 in JPEG format, totaling 21,000 images. The dataset is divided into three subsets for training, validation, and testing, with 70%, 15%, and 15% of the images allocated to each subset, respectively.

Problem Statement:

The manual sorting and identification of vegetables during production and distribution processes can be time-consuming and error-prone. To automate this process, we aim to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify images of various vegetables. By leveraging the power of deep neural networks, we seek to create a model that can classify vegetables with high accuracy, enabling efficient vegetable sorting and labeling without the need for human intervention.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust deep learning model capable of accurately classifying images of common vegetables. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following:

1. Train a deep neural network model using a dataset containing images of 15 different types of vegetables.
2. Validate the model's performance on a separate validation dataset to ensure generalization.
3. Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance on a test dataset to assess its real-world applicability.
4. Fine-tune the model to improve its performance if necessary.
5. Deploy the trained model to classify vegetable images automatically, facilitating efficient vegetable sorting and labeling processes.

By achieving these objectives, we aim to provide a practical solution to automate vegetable classification, thereby improving efficiency and reducing manual labor in vegetable production and distribution processes.
